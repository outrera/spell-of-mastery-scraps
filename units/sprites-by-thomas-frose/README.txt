This package includes golem, cerberus, small explosion sprites. 

I, Nikita Sakov, have purchased them from Thomas Fröse on March 4, 2015 and now release them under CC3-BY-SA license.

If used, prodvide link to http://opengameart.org/users/nikitasadkov and mention in your game's credits, that these assets came from my indie game "The Spell of Mastery". It would be nice if you also credit Thomas Fröse (T-Tree) - original artist, who agreed to sell these sprites.

For contacting me or sending donations use snv985@gmail.com

Your donations will be used to finish "The Spell of Mastery" game and produce more free to use assets.
