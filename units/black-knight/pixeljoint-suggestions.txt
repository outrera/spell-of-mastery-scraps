solid!! nice job with contrast to denote metal, and i like the contrast of the bblue cape. 

what can be improved- 


anatomy, legs look too tubular, childlike, lacks musculature and power. hand grabbing at mace is hard to read. actually, if you take off the clothes, the skeleton would look really funky, also a possible issue with perspective and stance. may want to draw skelly first as a base. 

colors- a bit too many to get the metal effect.   can slim down palette and add some more differing colors and more unique hues to get even better results with less.   this would also solve another problem with color. the ramps are linear and therefore gives a slight generic look to your sprite. 

on the pixel level you have unnecessary banding, specifically the legs and shoulders. Pixeling on the head is pretty good, but elsewhere needs refining. 

pose- not actiony enough. too friendly. lacks intention. is he primed to attack, or is he a 7 year old boy who confusingly put on armor and weapons? 

it's coming along nicely, and it already looks good, but you can take this much further!
